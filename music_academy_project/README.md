## step-1
# run next js install command and mnake a new project

# NOTE: EACH FOLDER HAVE LAYOUT AND PAGE MAINLY LAYOUT HAS THOSE THINGS WHICH WE WANT IN EACH PAGE 

## NOTE: RULES FOR NEW FOLDER
- IF I MAKE A FOLDER NAMED chai.jsx in the app folder AND MADE A FILE NAMED Chsai.jsx and we want to see this page on our website so here in next.js we dont need to make diffrent routes it are made default and we can access them by /chai but it will give an error as the rule is that you can make any folder but the name of file you want to display should be **page.tsx**
- ONE MORE THING TO REMEBER THAT IF WE HAVE SOMETHING IN THE LAYOUT IT WILL BE VISIBLE IN ALL THE PAGES but what if we create a new **layout.tsx** in the chai folder so what will happen is that /chai we will display both layout.tsx content so

## **IN SHORT THE CONTENT OF ROOT FOLDER LATOUT FILE WILL BE DISPLAYED TO THEIR CHILDREN FOLDER**
